                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                        <p>
                            In 1990 the dream came to life in the creation of Mentors International, a charitable organization offering a transformational program of mentoring, business training, and financial services to impoverished entrepreneurs.
                            The first partner organization was organized in Manila, and then expanded to El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru, and Ghana. Each organization has its own local board of directors and native staff, and is a subsidiary of Mentors International and is supervised by the US management team. Mentors International provides start-up support, training, operational funding, and loan capital for the partner organizations.
                            Over 4.3 million entrepreneurs are now enjoying the sweetness of prosperity because one man wanted to make a difference. They have decent housing. Their children are in school. They have at least two meals a day where one had been their norm. Nearly $77 million has been loaned through the micro-lending program with a 97% historical repayment rate.
                            While the world does feel good for the entrepreneurs served, many more are waiting for their opportunity.
                            You can make a difference, too.
